## Commit 0 - first commmit - 03/12/2024 | 19:25
This is the first commit to publish the repository on GitHub.

## Commit 1 - Set up initial project structure - 03/12/02024 | 19:50
The 'dev' folder will contain all the assets and HTML components/includes that will build the website.

CSS and JS files within the 'dev' folder will be minified to ensure fast website loading.

The original SCSS and JS files will be stored in the 'source' folder, which is at the same level as the 'dev' folder.

To handle minification, I will use Gulp.js, writing in SCSS and JS, and will use JavaScript libraries such as GSAP to animate the components.

## Commit 2 - Setup typography - 03/12/02024 | 22:40
Typography styling: font sizes, weights, and more. SCSS mixins have been created to easily modify text styles on different breakpoints.

Headings, various types of paragraphs, labels, and lists have been styled.

## Commit 2 - Setup header - 04/12/02024 | 00:20
